      <section class="about" aria-label="Introduction">
        <p>
          I am an undergraduate physics student focused on building a strong
          foundation in theory, computation, and scientific problem-solving.
          This site is a temporary academic home while I continue developing my
          coursework and research direction.

        <h2>Research Interests</h2>
        <p>
          My research interests broadly lie in general relativity, cosmology,
          and computational physics, with a particular curiosity about
          gravitational phenomena and large-scale structure in the universe. I
          am especially interested in how theoretical frameworks and numerical
          methods can be used to model and interpret astrophysical and
          cosmological systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I continue developing my mathematical and computational
          foundations, I am drawn to areas that combine physics, computation,
          and data-driven modeling, including gravitational waves, cosmological
          inference, and computational approaches to modern astrophysics.
